# Health-Notebook
### This Health notebook was developed as a part of the Smart Healthcare Hackathon conducted at Daksh, a Techno-management festival. It's aim is to give access to valid doctors and counselors for maintaining patient history after an authentication process with the Government's healthcare workers database (non-existent at the moment). This would allow the healthcare workers to treat people in a better way since they have access to previous medical prescription and records of the patients.
